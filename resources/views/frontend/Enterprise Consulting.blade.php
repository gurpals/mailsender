                        Enterprise Consulting</h3>
                    <p>Active Expert is proud to be a powerful resource for our clients business and enterprise partners. If you are here it’s likely because one of our existing clients, partners, students, or employee’s referred you. Take a moment to
                        learn about our offering, better yet schedule a call to see of Active Expert Consulting services is right for you. Before we go into to our offering, let’s ensure we’re on the same page when it comes to consulting. Many vendors
                        intertwine consulting and professional services, however, we look at these as two different service offerings and here’s why. Many IT companies and Value Added Resellers or VAR’s plan their consulting services around only selling
                        hardware, software, and services they are equipped to offer to maximize their sales. Some even offer to consult as a value-add, meaning it’s part of the “Sales Process”. They recover their consulting fees by selling hardware
                        or software they recommend as part of their consulting process. The problem is many times the right solution may include products or services from other vendors, or a variety of 3rd party vendors. Technology is changing to
                        fast for dated, single-vendor-hero models. In short, we are different.</p>
