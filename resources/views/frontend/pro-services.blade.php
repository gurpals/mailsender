                                Sure our team could help you design and deploy AWS solutions or Enterprise Data Center
                                but these are not engagements we would support today because they are not area’s we feel
                                we could deliver exceptionally well. We have SME’s
                                in both of these area’s at the Expert level, however, our professional services team is
                                focused on our core area’s Wireless, Security, and the expertise is there as “support
                                resources” should our core competencies cross these
                                other areas as they often do. </p>

                                        is collected, and reports
                                        are created laying the foundation for all other phases. Get this phase right and

                                        overlooked by many providers. It’s in this phase we get valuable feedback from
                                        clients in the operation phase, and further, optimize the
                                        solution the solution to meet customer goals and demands. While many providers
                                        plan and design to meet requirements and goals before equipment is ever
                                        installed, it’s only after our client provides feedback
                                        we can be certain objectives are met and teams are sufficiently trained to
                                        handle the day to day operations. The optimization phase can be the vital
                                        difference between overall success and failure of the technology.</p>
