                    <p>When you’re rolling out a new architecture like Enterprise Wireless Networks, SD-Access,
                        solutions like Zero Trust, or TrustSec, wouldn’t it be great if you could partner with someone
                        who had extensive real-world hand’s on experience in a variety of enterprise customer
                        environments who could guide you and your team on the journey and ensure your projects success?
                        By partnering with Active Expert on a Mentored Consulting engagement, you add a world class
                        professional services group, and a world-class instructor team to yours. Your then assigned a
                        Sr. Resource, who works with you throughout your entire project. Your quite literally working
                        with the same people writing the books on these technologies and it’s a key differentiator and
                        one of the reasons how we have grown the last decade without a direct sales force.
                        When you’re embarking on your next major journey, give us a call or submit a quote request to
                        see how we can help Make IT Happen for you. </p>
